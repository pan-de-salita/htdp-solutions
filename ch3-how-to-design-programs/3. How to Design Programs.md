What makes a *good* program: a short write-up that explains 
- what it does 
- what inputs it expects
- what it produces
- some assurance that it actually works

All of the above makes a **programming product**

##### 3.1 Designing Functions

###### Information and Data 
program describes computational process 
- how: input -> output 

**MVC (model-view-controller)**
- describes the way BSL and DR separate data processing from parsing information into data and turning data into information

###### Design Process
1. Express how you wish to represent information as data. 
2. Write down a signature, a statement of purpose, and a function header. 
	1. **Signature** - tells the reader how many inputs your function consumes, from which classes they are drawn, and what kind of data it prduces
	2. **Purpose statement** - summarizes the purpose of the function in a single line (every reader of your program should understand what your functions compute *without* having to read the function itself)
		1. Good programemrs write *two* purpose statements: one for the reader who may have to modify the code and another one for the person who wishes to use the program but not read it 
	3. **Header/stub** - a simplistic function definiton 

```Scheme
; Number String Image -> Image 
; adds s to img, y pixels from the top and 10 from the left 
(define (add-image y s img)
  (empty-scene 100 100))
```

3. Illustrate the signature and the purpose statement with some functional examples. To do so, pick one piece of data from each input class from the signature and determine what you expect back. 

```Scheme 
; Number -> Number 
; computes the area of a square with side len 
; given: 2, expect: 4
; given: 7, expect 40
(define (area-of-square len) 0)
```

4. Take inventory to understand what the givens are and what we need to compute. Also, replace the function's body with a *template*:

```Scheme 
(define (area-of-square len)
  (... len ...))
```

5. Code, that is, to replace the body of the function with an expression that attempts to compute from the pieces in the template what the purpose statement promises. 

```Scheme
; Number -> Number 
; computes the area of a square with side len 
; given: 2; expect: 4
; given: 7, expect: 49
(define (area-of-square len)
  (sqr len))
```

```Scheme 
; Number String Image -> Image 
; adds s to img, y pixels from top, 10 pixels to the left
; given: 
; 5 for y, 
; "hello" for s, and 
; (empty-scene 100 100) for img
; expected: 
; (place-image (text "hello" 10 "red") 10 5...)
; where ... is (empty-scene 100 100)
(define (add-image y s img)
  (place-image (text s 10 "red") 10 y img))
```

##### 3.4 From Functions to Programs
Creating a wish list. Every entry should consist of: 
- a meaningful name for the function
- a signature
- a purpose statement

For an interactive program, for example: 
- event handlers
- the `stop-when` function
- the scene-rendering function

```Scheme 
(define BACKGROUND (empty-scene 100 100))
(define DOT (circle 3 "solid" "red"))

(define (main y)
  (big-bang y   [on-tick sub1] ; event handler
				[stop-when zero?] ; stop-when function
				[to-draw place-dot-at] ; scene-rendering function
				[on-key stop])) ; event handler

(define (place-dot-at y)
  (place-image DOT 50 y background))

(define (stop y ke)
  0)
```

##### 3.5 On Testing
```Scheme
#lang htdp/bsl
(require test-engine/racket-tests)

; Number -> Number
; converts Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius
(define (f2c f)
  (* 5/9 (- f 32)))

(check-expect (f2c -40) -40)
(check-expect (f2c 32) 0)
(check-expect (f2c 212) 100)
(test)
```

##### 3.6 Designing World Programs

###### Wish list for designing world programs
```Scheme
; WorldState: data representing the current world (cw)

; WorldState -> Image
; when needed, big-bang obtains the image of the current
; state of the world by evaluating (render cw)
(define (render cw) ...)

; WorldState -> WorldState
; for each tick of the clock, big-bang obtains the next
; state of the world from (clock-tick-handler cw)
(define (clock-tick-handler cw) ...)

; WorldState String -> WorldState
; for each keystroke, big-bang obtains the next state
; from (keystroke-handler cw ke); ke represents the key
(define (keystroke-handler cw ke) ...)

; WorldState Number Number String -> WorldState
; for each mouse gesture, big-bang obtains the next state
; from (mouse-event-handler cw x y me) where x and y are
; the coordinates of the event and me is its description
(define (mouse-event-handler cw x y me) ...)

; WorldState -> Boolean
; after each event, big-bang evaluates (end? cw)
(define (end? cw) ...)

```

###### Sample problem
Design a program that moves a car from left to right on the world canvs, three picels per clock tick. 

1. Global constants
	1. "Physical" constants - describe general attributes of objects in the world
	2. Graphical constants - images of the objects in the world
2. A data representation for all possible states of the world
3. Design a number of functions so that you can form a valid big-bang expression
4. Write main function
