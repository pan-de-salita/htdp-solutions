### 4.4 itemizations
- generalizes enumerations and intervals
	- combines any already-defined data classes w/ each other and w/ indificual pieces of data

```Scheme 
;; data definition combining of 1String and strings
;; a KeyEvent is one of: 
;; - 1String
;; - "left"
;; - "right"
;; - "up"
;; - ...
```

```Scheme
;; an NorF is one of: 
;; - #false
;; - a Number

;; String -> NorF
;; converts the given string into a number;
;; produces #false if impossible
(define (string->number s) 
  (... s ...))

;; notice the two varieties of data: 
;; - a piece of data, #false
;; - a class of data, Numbers
```

#### sample problem 
design a program that launches a rocket when the user of your program presses the space bar. the program first displays the rocket sitting at the bottom of the canvas. once launched, it moves upward at three pixels per clock tick. 

given data definition: 
```Scheme
;; an LR (short for launching rocket) is one of: 
;; - "resting" | represents a grounded rocket
;; - NonnegativeNumber | denotes the height of a rocket in flight
```

| the interpretation of numbers is ambiguous in its notion of height: 
1. "height" could refer to the distance between the ground and the rocket's point of reference
2. "height" could mean the distance between the top of the canvas and the reference point
