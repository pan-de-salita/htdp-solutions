###### Keywords: 
- programming with restrictions
- enumerations - lists all data belonging to it (used for finite elements)  
- intervals - specifies ranges of data (used for "infinite" elements)
- itemizations - mixes enumerations and intervals; specifies ranges in one clause of its definition and specific pieces of data in another 
- designing conditional functions

### 4.1 Programming with Conditionals
> We therefore always use [cond](http://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/beginner.html#%28form._%28%28lib._lang%2Fhtdp-beginner..rkt%29._cond%29%29) for situations when we wish to remind the reader of our code that some distinct situations come directly from data definitions. For other pieces of code, we use whatever construct is most convenient.

###### summary
basically an introduction to `cond`.

### 4.2 computing conditionally
differentiating among the varying classes of inputs is the purpose of the `cond` expresson. (relevant: revisit order of procedures in SICP)

> DrRacket replaces function applications with the function's body after substituting the argument for the parameter. 

```Scheme 
#lang htdp/bsl
(require test-engine/racket-tests)

;; a positive-number is a number greater than/equal to 0.

;; positive-number -> string
;; computes the reward level from the given score s.
(define (reward s)
  (cond [(<= 0 s 10) "bronze"]
        [(and (< 10 s) (<= s 20)) "silver"]
        [else "gold"])) ;; complement of all previous conditions

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

(reward 3)
==
(cond [(<= 0 3 10) "bronze"])
	  [(and (< 10 3) (<= 3 20)) "silver"]
      [else "gold"])
==
(cond [#true "bronze")
	  [(and (< 10 3) (<= 3 20)) "silver"]
      [else "gold"])
== 
"bronze"

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

(reward 21)
== 
(cond [(<= 0 21 10) "bronze"]
	  [(and (< 10 21) (<= 21 20)) "silver"]
	  [else "gold"])
==
(cond [#false "bronze"]
	  [(and (< 10 21) (<= 21 20)) "silver"]
	  [else "gold"])
==
(cond [(and (< 10 21) (<= 21 20)) "silver"]
	  [else "gold"])
==
(cond [(and #true (<= 21 20)) "silver"]
	  [else "gold"])
==
(cond [(and #true #false) "silver"]
	  [else "gold"])
==
(cond [#false "silver"]
	  [else "gold"])
==
(cond [else "gold"])
== 
"gold"

```

> a `cond` expression is really just an expression and may therefore show up in the middle of another expression: 

```Scheme
;; from:
(define (create-rocket-scene.v4 h)
  (cond [(<= h ROCKET-CENTER-TO-TOP)
         (place-image ROCKET 50 h MTSCN)]
        [(> h ROCKET-CENTER-TO-TOP)
         (place-image ROCKET 50 ROCKET-CENTERTO-TOP MTSCN)]))

;; to:
(define (create-rocket-scene.v5 h)
  (place-image ROCKET
               50
               (cond [(<= h ROCKET-CENTER-TO-TOP) h]
                     [else ROCKET-CENTER-TO-TOP])
               MTSCN))
```

### 4.3 enumerations
what is enumeration? 
- a data representation in which every possibility is listed

###### designing a key-event handler systematically: 
```Scheme
; a KeyEvent is one of: 
; - 1String
; - "left"
; - "right"
; - "up"
; - ...

; WorldState KeyEvent -> ...
(define (handle-key-events w ke)
  (cond [(= (string-length ke) 1) ...]
	    [(string=? "left" ke) ...]
	    [(string=? "right" ke) ...]
	    [(string=? "up" ke) ...]
	    [(string=? "down" ke) ...]
	    ...))
```

###### sample problem 
design a key-event handler that moves a red dot left or right on a horizontal line in response to pressing the left and right arrow keys.

```Scheme
; a Position is a Number. 
; interpretation: distance between the left margin and the ball. 

; Position KeyEvent -> Position
; computes the next location of the ball

(check-expect (keh 13 "left") 8)
(check-expect (keh 13 "right") 18)
(check-expect (keh 13 "a") 13)

(define (keh p k)
  (cond [(= (string-length k) 1) p]
	    [(string=? "left" k) (- p 5)]
	    [(string=? "right" k) (+ p 5)]
	    [else p]))
== 
; a version that uses the three essential lines: two for the keys 
; that matter and one for everything else. The reordering is appropriate 
; because only two of the cond-lines are relevant, and they can be 
; cleanly separated from other lines.
(define (keh p k)
  (cond [(string=? "left" k) (- p 5)]
        [(string=? "right" k) (+ p 5)]
        [else p]))

```

### 4.4 intervals
###### sample problem 
- design a program that simulates the descent of a UFO. **see ufo.rkt**
- add a status line. it says "descending" when the UFO's height is above one third of the height of the canvas. it switches to "closing in" below that. and finally, when the UFO has reached the bottom of the canvas, the status notifies the player that the UFO has "landed". you are free to use appropriate colors for the status line. **see ufo-w-statline.rkt**

> An *interval* is a description of a class of numbers via *boundaries*. The simplest interval has two boundaries: left and right. If the left boundary is to be included in the interval, we say it is *closed* on the left. Similarly, a right-closed interval includes its right boundary. Finally, if an interval does not include a boundary, it is said to be *open* at the boundary. 

```Scheme
; a WorldState falls into on eof three intervals: 
; - between 0 and CLOSE
; - between CLOSE and HEIGHT
; - below HEIGHT

; WorldState -> WorldState
(define (f y)
  (cond [(<= 0 y CLOSE) ...]
	    [(<= CLOSE y HEIGHT) ...]
	    [(>= y HEIGHT) ...]))
==
(define (G y)
  (cond [(<= 0 y CLOSE) ...]
	    [(and (< CLOSE y) (<= y HEIGHT)) ...]
	    [(> y HEIGHT) ...]))
```

> Note how the second `cond` line uses `and` to combine a `<` and a `<=` instead of `f`'s `<=` with three arguments.

### 4.5 itemizations
```Scheme 
; An NorF if one of: 
; - #false
; - a Number

; NorF -> Number
; adds 3 to the given number; 3 otherwise
(check-expect (add3 #false) 3)
(check-expect (add3 0.12) 3.12)
(define (add3 x)
  (cond
  [(false? x) 3]
  [else (+ x 3)]))
```

> As above, the function's body consists of a `cond` expression with as many clauses as there are items in the enumeration of the data definition.  

###### sample problem 4.5.1
design a program that launches a rocket when the user of your program presses the space bar. the program first displays the rocket sitting at the bottom of the canvas. once launched, it moves upward at thtree pixels per clock tick. 

- what is the WorldState
	- KeyEvent?
	- clock tick?
	- can it be both? - this seems to be the answer. see below.
- event handlers?
	- clock-tick-handler
	- key-event handler

```Scheme
; An LR (short for launching rocket) is one of: 
; - "resting" 
; - NonnegativeNumber
; interpretation: "resting" represents a grounded rocket
; a number denotes the height of a rocket in flight
```

> [T]he interpretation of numbers is ambiguous in its notion of height: 
> 1. the word "height" could refer to the distance between the ground and the rocket's point of reference, say, its center; or 
> 2. it could mean the distance between the top of the canvas and the reference point.
